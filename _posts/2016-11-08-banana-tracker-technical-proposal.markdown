Banana Tracker
==============

**What is this supposed to do?**

Track bananas.

**What do you mean track bananas?**

I want to be able to track the price and location of those priced bananas in my city.

**How do you plan on collecting that data?**

At first I thought of walking around the city taking down written notes on the different stores with their addresses and the price they sold bananas. I then realized I had a computer in my pocket and decided to use it.

**What do you plan on doing with the data once collected?**

I have no idea yet.

Technical Proposal
------------------

### Introduction
Have the ability to track the ever changing price of bananas in general stores and fruit stores in and around my city.

### Cost of Deferring
Being in the dark when it comes to the price of bananas at any given time of the day. Not knowing where to find the best priced bananas in my neighbourhood, city or even region. There are probably many other costs of deferring but I'll limit myself to these.

### Proposal
A simple location on the web to keep notes on the prices of bananas in different stores. It would be comprised of a form allowing you to enter data on the banana(s) such as net price by weight. There would also be information about the store that offers such merchandise with information about its location, store hours, etc...
The following is an initial draft of the tables for such an endavour:

### Impact
The world will keep on spinning. BUT, the fact that I don't know the price of bananas will be annoying.
